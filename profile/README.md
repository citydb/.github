# 🌍 CityDB - City Intelligence & Decision Analytics Platform

Welcome to **CityDB**, a city intelligence and decision analytics platform built to help organizations understand **how cities operate, change, and respond to risk**.

CityDB transforms fragmented city-level data into a unified intelligence layer that supports high-stakes decisions related to risk, stability, and opportunity across cities and markets worldwide.
